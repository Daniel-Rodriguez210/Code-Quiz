# Code-Quiz
User Story:

AS A coding bootcamp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Development:

The languages to create this quiz include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I was tasked with building a easy to use quiz that asked a variety of entry level coding questions. 

I was pleased to having a function application quiz. 

I was unable to have the user input stored to the local storage to appear.
